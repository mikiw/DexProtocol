## Task

TODO: What will be the output of that task? Just document how to do it or some code?

# Centralized exchanges (CEX) vs decentralized exchanges (DEX).
TODO: Brief introduction into asset/stock exchange domain and explanation of two different concepts of exchanges. Centralized like NYSE/Nasdaq/Binance vs decentralized like Uniswap, dYdX.
TODO: Read more about DeFi's, DEXs and AMMs and write down core concepts.

## CEX vs DEX Problems.
TODO: Write down core problems with moving from centralized to decentralized exchanges like:
- Orderbooks vs AAM
- What if small order for 1$ will trigger a waterfall of other orders for 100000$, who will pay the gas fee?
- Off-chain vs on-chain and game theory behind that in both cases in case of market makers
- How arbitration of off-chain market makers will work in a decentralized world? Will it be worth competing from a game theory perspective?
- Read more about matching algorithms on exchanges.
- How to simulate these custom made blockchain/exchanges/makers behaviors before launch? For example in Anylogic? Maybe Dexter (https://dexter-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)? 

# Solutions.
TODO: Brief introduction of solutions for given problems.
TODO: What is Asset/Order data structure? What contracts are needed? Or how custom-made blockchain will look like?
TODO: Who will pay for gas? Clients of order or market makers?
TODO: If we have an order book 
TODO: Orders with a lump sum fee for all like in a centralized world (NYSE/Nasdaq/Binance) that the client needs to pay?
TODO: Competing market makers with a lump sum or dynamic fees?

## Wyvern Protocol.
TODO: Brief introduction of Wyvern v3 on Ethereum (https://wyvernprotocol.com/ & https://wyvernprotocol.com/docs).
TODO: Read implementation https://github.com/wyvernprotocol/wyvern-v3/tree/master/contracts.
TODO: Check https://exchange.projectwyvern.com/.

### Similar protocol to Wyvern.
TODO: Read more and write down core concepts about Etherdelta (https://github.com/etherdelta/smart_contract), 0x (https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo), and Dexy (https://github.com/DexyProject/protocol)
